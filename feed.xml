The holiday period, as well as being very busy personally, took a bit of a toll on the progress of this project over the last couple of months. Nevertheless, progress has been made, and I’ll be able to pick this back up a lot more in the future (with a potentially exciting announcement to come).

A few warnings for if you’re considering reading: Although I’ll be doing my best to make this be readable, I would discourage any expectations for any of this to be ‘essay-tier’, per se. This is basically just thoughts and progress spewed out onto a reasonable medium. I understand that it’s likely that pretty much nobody reads... </summary> </entry> </feed>
