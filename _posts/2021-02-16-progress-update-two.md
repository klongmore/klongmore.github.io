**_A small update for a big time-frame, I'm aware._**

The holiday period, as well as being very busy personally, took a bit of a toll on the progress of this project over the last couple of months.

Nevertheless, progress has been made, and I'll be able to pick this back up a lot more in the future (with a potentially exciting announcement to come).

## Reverted to old/imported sprites

Although I do enjoy making art for the game, I was kind of bottlenecking myself by waiting for art. This is something I'll have to solve in the future, but for now I think it's much more important that I'm working on the core functionality of the game.

<br />

## Did some writing

I started to flesh out how I want the game to begin, and some key points that will be important to gameplay programming. I did a lot of research into narrative writing, as well as archetypal storylines, as well as how to implement them specifically into a video-game medium.

This is what I'm going to continue working on in the immediate future.

## Created an inventory system

This is the biggest thing I have been working on (although it didn't take as long as I thought it might to implement).

The game now has a working inventory system, where items can be created, picked up, inspected, and destroyed.

I decided on using the dialogue system to display this information, and a lot of work was put into avoiding sequence-breaking exploits around using the inventory and dialogue scripts at the same time. The UI is basic for now, but more than does what I need it to.

You can see a basic demonstration of the inventory system at the bottom of this post.

Oh, and I cleaned up my project with a fine-tooth comb, so it's much nicer to work in now :)

I will be working on:

* Writing research and narrative writing
* Implementing basic sounds
* Making a larger starting area to test/showcase new mechanics and functionality.
